<h1 class="about-me-title">Who am I?</h1>

<p class="about-me-text">
From Computer Science to Business Studies to Graphic Design, like most people I had trouble deciding what to do with my life, because I was interested in several things at the same time,
the deciding point for me was when I looked at everything I had been doing and went for the one that made me the happiest.
<br>
<br>
Why did I end up choosing Graphic Design you are asking? (If you are asking).
<br>
<br>
Well, I got into it when I created a logo for one of my childhood friends and he loved it, making something from nothing its such an amazing feeling and have the person you are making it
for love it and use it it’s a great feeling. I really enjoy making other people excited and happy about a design idea for their projects that they could be proud of using.
Within Graphic Design the area I like the most is creating logos, because it’s how I started and I learned how important and incredibly unique each logo is. Whenever I hear about the story
behind a certain logo and the reason behind it’s design I get really pumped to make something with a story behind, or a playful idea that will get anyone that see it feel happy or just smile
for a second.
<br>
<br>
I’m a sucker for new things. I could easily be caught watching how to create music out of a tuna can just because it looks and sounds cool, even if I don’t go for it and make it, I will be
satisfied with knowing how it works. At the moment I’m learning how to play songs that I like on the ukulele, how to be a fully grown responsible/workaholic adult, and how to write an about
me section that doesn’t make you want to sleep, (How am I doing so far?).
<br>
<br>
I have an angry fucker resting face, but don’t let that intimidate you, I don’t bite (only food) I am very friendly and even though I get very nervous sometimes when I meet new people I love
getting to know others. So, get in contact with me if you like what I do and you think it will suit your idea, I’m here to help you obtain something you will love to call yours.
